title: Week 4 - The Contributor - Project Search
---

<p align="center"> <em> My preliminary open source project search, in the style of reality TV show <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bachelor_(American_TV_series)"> The Bachelor</a>. </em> </p>
<p align="center"> <em> Also: Words with Friends and other weekly contributions </em> </p>

# theQuestion = "To Fork, or Not to Fork"

If you've never seen *The Bachelor*: 
* First, you probably aren't missing out on much. (I haven't either)
* Second, it is essentially a televised elimination-style competition drama show about several women vying to be the final choice as romantic interest for a bachelor. 
* Third, why am I mentioning a reality TV show in a blog about Open Source Development? For parody reasons, of course!

Introducting *The Contributor*, where one contributor (me) gets to know several Open Source projects to find the perfect match. Projects that stay in consideration get a fork instead of a rose, and the final project standing might just get (a contribution) proposed!

Before I list the projects and which candidates made it through the round, I want to note my own biases. Essentially all of the projects I looked at had codebases hosted on Github, because it is the software [forge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forge_(software)) I'm most familiar with. I feel as though I should make an effort to at least get slightly more acquainted with other sites, mainly [Gitlab](https://about.gitlab.com/). Also, though I am probably in the minority in this, lack of an explicit CODE OF CONDUCT document is not a deal breaker for me when considering a project. From my limited experience it seems smaller projects more often don't have them. If I don't see any glaring issues when browsing a project's activity and discussions in issues/requests, I'm willing to take the benefit of the doubt and assume the community follows a general [golden rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Rule) standard. I want to believe the open source community as a whole is more good than not.  Having the document is of course an important plus though, and very good practice in general. 


## Round 1: Welcomeness

* ### [Origami.js](https://raphamorim.io/origamijs/) ([GPL v3.0](https://github.com/raphamorim/origami.js/blob/master/COPYING)): HTML5 Canvas Library
  *  The name of this project is slightly misleading, as it has little to do with the paper folding art. Slow activity in past several months, so it probably won't be practical in the timeframe of a semester.
* ### [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) ([LGPL v2.1](https://github.com/processing/p5.js/blob/master/license.txt)): Artsy and Educational JS Library
  * Very good candidate and extremely welcoming! Just need to find an issue that fits what I can do.
* ### [Albert](https://albertlauncher.github.io/) (GPL v3.0) : Desktop Launcher
  * 
* ### [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/) ([MIT](https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/master/LICENSE)): Web Dev, but for Desktop Apps
* ### [The Fuck](https://github.com/nvbn/thefuck) ([MIT](https://github.com/nvbn/thefuck/blob/master/LICENSE.md)): Dirty Name, Clean Terminal Commands
  * Excuse the bad language.
* ### [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) ([APACHE v2.0](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/blob/master/LICENSE)): Static Site Generator Built in Go
  * This would be good for practicing Go.
* ### [Manim](https://github.com/3b1b/manim) ([MIT](https://github.com/3b1b/manim/blob/master/LICENSE)\*): Math Animation
  * Made by Youtuber 3b1b.
* ### [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/) ([BSD 2-Clause](https://github.com/Leaflet/Leaflet/blob/master/LICENSE)): JS Map Library
* ### [React-Leaflet](https://react-leaflet.js.org/) ([MIT](https://github.com/PaulLeCam/react-leaflet/blob/master/LICENSE)): Leaflet, but in React
* ### [Memegen](https://memegen.link/)  ([MIT](https://github.com/jacebrowning/memegen/blob/master/LICENSE.md)): Meme Generator API
  * They need developer installation docs.


# Peer-Reviewed Journals ?

I began editing some of my peers blogs, mostly making small grammar and wording changes.

# Back to the Map

I added several restaurants in the neighborhood around the Hunter dorms! I've noticed that many of the food places in the area south of Murray Hill are missing on the map, so I might plan an excursion into 'Little India' in the coming weeks.

# Email SchmEmail

I have been working on a contribution to the openstreetmap website repo throughout this week, but my last comment has not been responded to for several days :(. There appear to only be two maintainers, so I'll just have to wait to see when they'll comment. Perhaps they may even merge the pull request! (Wishful thinking).

Tune in next time to see which projects can make it through the installation challenge!
