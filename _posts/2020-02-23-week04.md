title: Week 4 - The Contributor - Project Search
---


<p align="center"> <em> My preliminary open source project search, in the style of reality TV show <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bachelor_(American_TV_series)"> The Bachelor<a>. </em> </p>
<p align="center"> <em> Also: Words with Friends and other weekly contributions </em> </p>

# theQuestion = "To Fork, or Not to Fork"

If you've never seen *The Bachelor*: first, you probably aren't missing out on much. Second, it is essentially a televised elimination-style competition between several women vying to be the final choice as romantic interest for a bachelor. Third, why am I mentioning a reality TV show in a blog about Open Source Development? For parody reasons, of course! Introducting *The Contributor*, where one contributor (me) puts several Open Source projects through a series of trials. Projects that pass get a fork instead of a rose, and the final project standing might just get (a contribution) proposed!

## Round 1: Welcomeness

I have been working on the contribution to the openstreetmap website repo throughout this week, but am still waiting on a response :(.
