# theQuestion = "To Fork, or Not to Fork"

If you've never seen *The Bachelor*: 
* First, you probably aren't missing out on much. (I haven't either)
* Second, it is essentially a televised elimination-style competition drama show about several women vying to be the final choice as romantic interest for a bachelor. 
* Third, why am I mentioning a reality TV show in a blog about Open Source Development? For parody reasons, of course!

Introducing *The Contributor*, where one contributor (me) gets to know several Open Source projects to find the perfect match. Projects that stay in consideration get a fork instead of a rose, and the final project standing might just get (a contribution) proposed!

Before I list the projects and which candidates made it through the round, I want to note my own biases. Essentially all of the projects I looked at had codebases hosted on Github, because it is the software [forge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forge_(software)) I'm most familiar with. I feel as though I should make an effort to at least get slightly more acquainted with other sites, mainly [Gitlab](https://about.gitlab.com/). Also, though I am probably in the minority in this, lack of an explicit CODE OF CONDUCT document is not a deal breaker for me when considering a project. From my limited experience it seems smaller projects more often don't have them. If I don't see any glaring issues when browsing a project's activity and discussions in issues/requests, I'm willing to take the benefit of the doubt and assume the community follows a general [golden rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Rule) standard. I want to believe the open source community as a whole is more good than not.  Having the document is of course an important plus though, and very good practice in general. 


## Round 1: Welcomeness

* ### [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) ([LGPL v2.1](https://github.com/processing/p5.js/blob/master/license.txt)): Artsy and Educational JS Library
  * Very good candidate and extremely welcoming! I just need to find an issue that fits my abilities and scope. :fork_and_knife:
* ### [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/) ([MIT](https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/master/LICENSE)): Web Dev, but for Desktop Apps
  * This project is extremely active, with thousands of issues, recent commits, and beginner friendly labels. Definitely a fork.
* ### [The Fuck](https://github.com/nvbn/thefuck) ([MIT](https://github.com/nvbn/thefuck/blob/master/LICENSE.md)): Dirty Name, Clean Terminal Commands
  * Excuse the bad language. This is a cool command line tool that helps correct types or incorrect console commands. It is fairly active, with basic but still inviting documents. Since the project is relatively small I can see myself trying to add or fix a bug in a use case relevant to myself. Would fork.
* ### [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) ([APACHE v2.0](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/blob/master/LICENSE)): Static Site Generator Built in Go
  * This project is very inviting and beginner friendly. The only real barrier to contributing is my experience level with programming in Go: zero. Am I willing/able to try to learn a new language within a semester just to possibly make a contribution? :fork_and_knife:
* ### [Manim](https://github.com/3b1b/manim) ([MIT](https://github.com/3b1b/manim/blob/master/LICENSE)\*): Math Animation
  * This animation library was created by math Youtuber [3b1b](https://www.3blue1brown.com/), originally for his videos. As such, it is pretty small, but active despite this. From a glance in the issue discussions, the community seems very helpful. The README does mention a dire need for documentation ... :fork_and_knife:
* ### [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/) ([BSD 2-Clause](https://github.com/Leaflet/Leaflet/blob/master/LICENSE)): JS Map Library
  * Built using OpenStreetMap, this project is also very beginner friendly. The CONTRIBUTING doc mentions that they have a specific goal of keeping the library fast and simple, so I'd have to keep that in mind when thinking about contributing. Leaflet gets a fork.
* ### [React-Leaflet](https://react-leaflet.js.org/) ([MIT](https://github.com/PaulLeCam/react-leaflet/blob/master/LICENSE)): Leaflet, but in React
  * This is smaller than Leaflet, but follows the same ideals and seems just as open to contributions. :fork_and_knife:
* ### [Memegen](https://memegen.link/)  ([MIT](https://github.com/jacebrowning/memegen/blob/master/LICENSE.md)): Meme Generator API
  * A project focused on memes? Sign me up. There is a fair amount of activity, a good-first-issue label exists, and the essential documents are straightforward. They also mention a need for more developer installation docs. :fork_and_knife:
* ### [Origami.js](https://raphamorim.io/origamijs/) ([GPL v3.0](https://github.com/raphamorim/origami.js/blob/master/COPYING)): HTML5 Canvas Library
  *  The name of this project is slightly misleading, as it has little to do with the paper folding art. Origami.js is a library built to make using the [Canvas API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API) for drawing graphics easier. The CONTRIBUTING document is basic, but [very polite and encouraging](https://github.com/raphamorim/origami.js/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#thank-you). However, there has been very slow activity in past several months, so it probably won't be practical in the timeframe of a semester. This project does not get a fork.
* ### [Albert](https://albertlauncher.github.io/) (GPL v3.0) : Desktop Launcher
  * This project also seems to have little recent activity. The last commit was over a year ago. The installation docs don't have any macOS instructions though, so I could possibly contribute by making a guide for that, but for the moment: no fork. 

Overall, I'd be willing to contribute to most of the projects listed here, so as I continue to search and evaluate I'll be narrowing down acceptible criteria for a project choice. 

# PR From the Other Side

This week I began editing some of my peers blogs, mostly [making small grammar and wording changes](https://github.com/hunter-college-ossd-spr-2020/ElijahCano33-weekly/pull/2), and also fixing an [incorrectly formatted markdown link](https://github.com/hunter-college-ossd-spr-2020/dmallia17-weekly/pull/2). On the flip side, I also [merged my first PR](https://github.com/hunter-college-ossd-spr-2020/boubascript-weekly/pull/1) (pull-request) as a maintainer, which was an interesting experience. The activity gives some insight into what it's like at the other end of our contributions and pull requests, having to make sure outside changes are useful, don't break anything, and merge without issues. It's an entirely different frame of mind.

# [\#1, \#2, create issue; \#3, \#4 commit more](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One,_Two,_Buckle_My_Shoe)

Through looking at several pull requests and issues in peer blogs, I discovered a quirk of Github: issues and pull requests share the same numbering sequence. Before taking this course I never took more than a cursory glance at the pull request or issue tabs, and in the first few weeks we only looked at relatively large, more established project repositories with hundreds or thousands of issues/PRs, so I never would have noticed this before. When an issue is first created, it is identified by #1, and following issues increment from there, but when a pull request is made it picks up from where issues left off, and vice versa. 

Of course one of my first thoughts was that this means certain PR/issue numbers will simply not exist in a project. That possibility combined with the knowledge that Github uses the url schemes `<user>/<repo>/pull/<pullnumber>` and `<user>/<repo>/issues/<issuenumber>` for pull request and issue urls respectively led to a slightly cooler discovery: Github automatically redirects the pull/issue text in the url based on the # being passed. For instance, in dmallia17's blog repository, there is an issue labeled #1 and a pull request labeled #2. If I visit [dmallia17-weekly/pull/1](https://github.com/hunter-college-ossd-spr-2020/dmallia17-weekly/pull/1), the site will automatically change the url to dmallia17-weekly/issues/1. This only reinforces the idea that Github developers made a deliberate choice to make them share the same pool of IDs. The redirect behavior probably doesn't carry through in other places such as the API though, but I haven't looked into that (yet). I attempted to look into why they don't have numbering independent of each other, but only found a github community forum [post](https://github.community/t5/How-to-use-Git-and-GitHub/Why-is-it-that-Pull-Requests-and-Issues-share-the-same-numbering/td-p/22928) with some thoughts and no official answer. It does sort of make sense after some thought, since PRs and issues are very closely related in a project. I think the reasoning could also involve the fact that PR/issue numbers preceded by a '#' can be used to mention any issue or PR from any other issue or PR, and if they had independent numbering there would be conflicts (i.e are you mentioning issue #2 or PR #2?). 

While checking the uniqueness of this behavior I found that Gitlab actually uses an independent numbering system, with issues preceded by a '#' and [merge requests](https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2017/09/11/comparing-confusing-terms-in-github-bitbucket-and-gitlab/#pull-requests-vs-merge-requests) (their term for a pull request) preceded by a '!'. The more you know.

Though this tidbit will most likely never come up in practice while using Github and getting involved with issues and pull requests and the like, it was noteworthy to me and may even possibly come in handy in some niche edge use cases.

# Back to the Map

I added several restaurants in the neighborhood around the Hunter dorms on OpenStreetMap. I've noticed that many of the food places in the area south of Murray Hill are missing on the map, so I might plan an excursion into 'Little India' in the coming weeks.

# Email-SchmEmail

I have been working on [a contribution](https://github.com/openstreetmap/openstreetmap-website/pull/2542) to the openstreetmap website repo mentioned last week, but my last comment has not been responded to for several days :(. Besides that I've had a solid back and forth with maintainer feedback involving discussions about [email regexes in ruby](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22993545/ruby-email-validation-with-regex). There appear to only be two maintainers, so I'll just have to wait to see when they'll comment again. Perhaps they may even merge the pull request! (*Wishful thinking*).
