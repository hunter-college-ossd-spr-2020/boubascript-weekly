# Up and Atom

With the first (and probably only) season of *The Contributor: Project Search* fully behind me, it is time to fully get into the main task for this semester: working with [my](https://hunter-college-ossd-spr-2020.github.io/dmallia17-weekly/week07/) [team](https://hunter-college-ossd-spr-2020.github.io/wongjessica-weekly/week07/) to make some contributions to Atom, and maybe even infiltrating the community along the way. Everyone had struggles with the installation, but together we all managed to successfully install and run a development build of Atom from source. Go team! Now, it was time to step back and try to figure out Atom's bigger molecular picture.

## Packages All the Way Down 

The first thing we learned was that what most people consider 'Atom' is actually just a bunch of separate packages [in a trench coat](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TotemPoleTrench). Having actually read a good amount of the flight manual, Daniel mentioned several important things about this system.

## The Root of the Issue

With such a wide search area for issues, we did what any post-algorithms CS major would do when looking for the shortest path to a contribution: try a breadth first search. We thought up a general approach of first determining the core packages under Atom that have the most potential for beginner contributions, adding those to the queue of potential packages to contribute to, then working through each package in the queue by creating issues or searching for and resolving them. Of course, much easier pseudocoded than done.

We eventually stepped back yet again and looked more into flight manual documentation contributions.

# [The Wikipedia Game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Wiki_Game)

I've finally started peeking into the huge ecosystem of everyone's favorite encyclopedia, Wikipedia. They have a very strong philosophy stressed on all the beginner help pages.

## Wiki, Wiki, on the 'Net, How Do I Get My Feet Wet?

Contributing to Wikipedia seems as simple as it is made out to be, though it may seem like there's a lot going on. The help pages are extensive, thorough, and abundant, so I expect a gentle learning curve with a relatively quick time getting into actual edits. 

## Much I Know About Nothing

The challenge for me might be trying to figure out where exactly to make contributions. I have a shallow, passing knowledge of many things, and to me it seems Wikipedia edits will come much easier to people with a deep knowledge of specific fields, like a hobby or deep interest. Nevertheless, 

# [What We Owe To Each Other](https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2019/10/10/scanlon-and-the-good-place/)

This [piece](https://gist.github.com/richhickey/1563cddea1002958f96e7ba9519972d9) on entitlement in the Open Source community, though highly abrasive, makes really great points about the 'social contract' between founders/leadership/maintainers and contributors/users of a project. 

# const change;

Classes were canceled this week due to the heightening COVID-19 situation, and with so many things changing so rapidly I didn't get to much of my planned periodic contributions from last week. I did manage to organize my thoughts for an [issue](https://github.com/duckduckgo/duckduckgo-privacy-extension/issues/436) in the [DuckDuckGo Privacy Extension](https://github.com/duckduckgo/duckduckgo-privacy-extension) project's [`CONTRIBUTING` doc](https://github.com/duckduckgo/duckduckgo-privacy-extension/blob/develop/CONTRIBUTING.md).
