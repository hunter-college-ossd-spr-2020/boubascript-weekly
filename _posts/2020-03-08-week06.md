# A New Challenger Appears
*Previously, on The Contributor ...*
> My project finalists are Gatsby, Visual Studio Code, and Electron. They're all welcoming, super active, promising projects where I can see myself making meaningful contributions.

*And now, back to this week:*

The final semester project choice is .... *none of the above!* I may have left out the fact that the winner of *The Contributor* is a project that I can work on **with a team**. Though I may circle back to the projects mentioned in the previous weeks for my own personal contributions, the main project choice also depended on input from my team members.

# Attempting Nuclear Fusion (Building Atom from Source)

The Atom installation instructions seem veeery simple and straightforward, there are only 2 commands according to the manual. However, dependencies are a thing that exist and cause many headaches.

# The Periodic Table of Contributions
I haven't had much time to make other contributions this week, so instead I'll share my plans for upcoming contributions.
