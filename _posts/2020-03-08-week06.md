# A New Challenger Appears
## *Previously, on The Contributor ...*
> My project finalists are [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/), [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), and [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/). They're all welcoming, super active, promising projects where I can see myself making meaningful contributions.

## *And now, to the finale:*
The final project for the semester is .... *none of the above!* 

I may have left out the fact that the winner of *The Contributor* must be a project that I can work on **with a team**. Though I may circle back to the projects mentioned in the previous weeks/episodes for my own personal contributions, the main project choice for this course also depends on input from my team members. Contributing to an open source project as a team changes the dynamic, since other developers' strengths, weaknesses, and interests must now be factored in. This shouldn't really come as a surprise though, given the inherent 'working together' nature of open source and the necessity of team work as a skill in tech in general. (The 'show' should really be titled *The Contributors*, but hindsight is always a clear solution. Perhaps a spinoff is due? ...) Balancing this [synthesis equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction#Synthesis) of skill sets as we work toward producing substantial contributions is part of the fun!

## *The Team*: Move Over Fantastic Four, introducing the *Thorough Three*

I have the great opportunity to be teamed up with skilled developers and generally cool humans [Daniel](https://hunter-college-ossd-spr-2020.github.io/dmallia17-weekly/about/) and [Jessica](https://hunter-college-ossd-spr-2020.github.io/wongjessica-weekly/about/) for the semester. I'll be interchangeably referring to them using their English and Github usernames ([@dmallia17](https://github.com/dmallia17) and [@wongjessica](https://github.com/wongjessica)) from here on out. As project updates are pushed up each week, I encourage you to read their (very interesting) blog posts (if you haven't been already) to get their perspectives on the various issues we come across and project-related topics discussed.

## *(Indecisiveness)^3*

Even with all the benefits my team members brought, coming together only seemed to amplify individual indecisiveness when choosing a team project. To be fair, it *is* a semester long commitment and we wanted to be thorough when vetting potential choices. Unfortunately, this meant being the only team that hadn't made a choice by the end of class on Monday, March 2nd &mdash; a class for which the main objective was each team having a project selected. What we did have, instead, was a narrowed down short list of candidates: [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/), Visual Studio Code, and [Atom](https://atom.io/). I also suggested Electron from my list to the team later in the week. 

## *Elimination Round*
Several projects were dropped over some long discussions and many texts throughout the week. Since we had already accounted for welcomeness and programming languages, the most important factor in consideration was a project's potential for multiple substantial contributions accepted from us. This included the perceived learning curve, availability of accessible issues, and how smooth the development process seemed.

* Django and Electron were the first to go, on Thursday March 5th. The Django community uses an in house [issue tracker](https://code.djangoproject.com/), which was not too bad to navigate but just off-putting for the fact of being different from what we were already comfortable with. This wasn't the deal breaker though. Issues tagged with [easy pickings](https://code.djangoproject.com/query?status=!closed&easy=1) did not look very approachable, and on top of that none of us had experience developing on frameworks. Similar to Electron, the main use case for the project is creating other projects. For many bugs and features, we'd need some sort of sample project already using Django/Electron just to replicate the bug or try  out the feature. Using a framework to build an app is very different from building on a framework itself. Perhaps some other team during some other semester. 
* Finally, Visual Studio Code also fell under my team's collective scrutiny. The VS Code repository has [over 4,000 open issues](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues), but the issues seem to be cluttered with user bug reports that have less to do with the functionality/documentation of the code editor itself and more individual case by case configuration problems (e.g app install complications, various operating system specific troubles). Though we all use Visual Studio Code as our main IDE, we also all use macOS devices, which would restrict our search area a lot.

## *The Meat of the Matter*

By Friday we arrived at our final decision, the only project still standing: Atom, the hackable text editor. Though there's a lack of currently open [beginner friendly](https://github.com/atom/atom/issues) labeled issues, the issues in general looked approachable and accessible to us beginners. Atom is also more of its own end product, which means we will be able to run the app, test changes, and see the functionality occuring directly.  

I must mention, though, that Atom is built using Electron (the science pun there writes itself :smirk:).

# Attempting Nuclear Fusion (Building Atom from Source)

Daniel got a head start on the <strike> table-flipping </strike> &thinsp; installation process, making the radical move to actually read through the [flight manual](https://flight-manual.atom.io/) documentation provided by Atom to get a preliminary feel for how the project is organized. We all agreed to start with the [Hacking on Atom Core](https://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/hacking-on-atom-core/#platform-mac) guide, and attempt to get a dev version of the core Atom application running. When first browsing the page, I noticed right away Python v2.7 being listed as a [requirement](https://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/hacking-on-atom-core/#requirements). Even though it was technically in the 'Running Core Tests" section, this stuck out as a potential problem to me because Python 2 was [officially deprecated earlier this year](https://www.python.org/doc/sunset-python-2/), with many programs, packages, and applications making a move to Python 3. I highly suspected some sort of issue with dependencies might pop up due to this, but pushed on with installing nonetheless...

The Atom core installation instructions seem very simple and straightforward, since there there are only 2 commands to run after the typical fork/clone/cd into directory routine: `script/bootstrap` and `atom --dev $PWD`. These would respectively install all necessary dependencies, then set an environment variable so that the atom command would run Atom using the current local folder rather than the usual install location. 

## How Not To [Pull Yourself Up By Your Bootstrap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bootstrapping#Etymology)

Since Daniel had already been on the front line, I had an idea of what the first error would be before even running the script myself &mdash; the newest versions of [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) would not work. The most current version of Node (as of this post) is 13, and the latest [Active LTS](https://nodejs.org/en/about/releases/) version is 12, but the leveldown@4.0.2 (leveldown at version 4.0.2 specifically) dependency does not compile past Node 10. Daniel confirmed that he got further in the process by switching to an earlier Node version, and I found [an issue](https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/20367) in the Atom repository mentioning this specific problem that was also solved by changing versions.

Before this, I was loathe to simply switch Node versions to fix a dependency issue because most times the real problem has to do with the project itself not using the latest versions of dependencies, and deleting the `package-lock.json` file and re-installing with `npm install` usually fixes things. However, I haven't worked with projects this large before, and I never really had to worry about integrating changes upstream in the past anyway. I've now realized my past approach is actually kind of '[bad practice](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/bad%20practice)' and only works in very specific cases. Ironically, projects can't depend on the dependencies they use to always stay consistent in the latest versions with implementations, and sometimes it is just necessary to use an older, stabler version of a dependency to keep a project running smoothly. And thus, I finally made the plunge to start using [`nvm`](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm), a command line manager for Node versions. I have to say, I don't think I'll ever be looking back because so far it has been so easy to install and switch between different Node versions using nvm. It's even recommended by Atom in the Hacking on Atom Core guide itself!

With the first hurdle over pretty quickly, I figured the install process should be pretty easy to handle from then on. I figured wrong. 


# The Periodic Table of Contributions
I haven't had much time to make other contributions this week, so instead I'll share my plans for upcoming contributions.
