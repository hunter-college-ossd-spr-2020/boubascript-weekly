title: Week 1 - Use the (Open) Source, Luke!

<p align="center"> <em>Why I am taking an Open Source class</em></p>


I am taking this course essentially because I find the idea of Open Source, the philosophy, and the community really cool. I have been meaning to get involved in Open Source for a while now, but I kept putting it off due to other work. Now that I have to dive into Open Source for a course, I have no excuse to learn more about what Open Source really is, and to finally make attempts at contributing to software that people use. I strongly believe in learning by doing, and open source projects are a perfect way to improve my skills as a software engineer in the real world.
