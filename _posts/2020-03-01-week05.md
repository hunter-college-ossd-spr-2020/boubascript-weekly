# [You commit often](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/do_you_come_here_often)? <br> And Other Open Source Pick Up Lines

Before I reveal my top 3 project choices, I'll take a step back and build some suspense by reflecting on the evaluation process behind these decisions. Last week was more similar to a speed dating round, where I casually clicked through some projects and formed an opinion based off of a limited inspection. For this episode, I got to know some projects a little more by taking a closer look at their activity levels, code bases, documentation, and discussion interactions. There was even an official [evaluation template](https://github.com/hunter-college-ossd-spr-2020/project-evaluation/blob/master/evaluation_template.md) provided by [our professor](https://github.com/stewartweiss), so I guess you can say things are getting pretty serious. :wink:

The evaluation process was more tedious most times than difficult, and information being very hard to find for a project was a telling sign of the project's viability as a candidate. I learned a lot about advanced Github issue searching. 

## We Go Together Like Markdown and HTML

An issue came up during my first evaluation with fellow team members [Daniel](https://hunter-college-ossd-spr-2020.github.io/dmallia17-weekly/about/) and [Jessica](https://hunter-college-ossd-spr-2020.github.io/wongjessica-weekly/about/) regarding combining HTML with Markdown. We didn't even realize it until after submitting a pull request because the VSCode Markdown Preview didn't have any issues, but Github Markdown broke for our file. Eventually we figured out it was a spacing/indent problem around HTML <br> tags that was causing surrounding markdown formatting to not get applied.


And now, finally, the moment you've definitely been waiting for. <br>
Keyboard tap drumroll please.......

# Top 3 Projects

# Purple Haze

My [contribution](https://github.com/openstreetmap/openstreetmap-website/pull/2542) to the openstreetmap-website repo was merged this week! :tada: Purple has never looked better. Now that I've officially gone through a full contributing cycle, I've realized many important lessons were learned/re-emphasized along the way:

* **Follow the Git Workflow** - I accidentally made the pull request from the master branch of my fork instead of a feature branch, and learned the hard way why it should be done that way. Luckily it didn't affect my pull request too much, but it could have been worse.
* **Double check code styling** - I didn't fix a linter problem before creating the pull request which delayed my pull request a bit since maintainers moved on while I was fixing a file length issue.
* **Make sure a feature is necessary** - Arguably one of the most important. I really wanted to implement email linking for semi-colon separated lists of emails, but the data showed it simply wasn't relevant enough to warrant the code complexity that would be introduced.
