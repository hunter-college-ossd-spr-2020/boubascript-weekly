Before I reveal my top 3 project choices, I'll take a step back and build some suspense by reflecting on the evaluation process behind these decisions.

# Purple Haze

My [contribution](https://github.com/openstreetmap/openstreetmap-website/pull/2542) to the openstreetmap-website repo was merged this week! :tada: Purple has never looked better. Now that I've officially gone through a full contributing cycle, I've realized many important lessons were learned/re-emphasized along the way:

* **Follow the Git Workflow** - I accidentally made the pull request from the master branch of my fork instead of a feature branch, and learned the hard way why it should be done that way. Luckily it didn't affect my pull request too much, but it could have been worse.
* **Double check code styling** - I didn't fix a linter problem before creating the pull request which delayed my pull request a bit since maintainers moved on while I was fixing a file length issue.
* **Make sure a feature is necessary** - Arguably one of the most important. I really wanted to implement email linking for semi-colon separated lists of emails, but the data showed it simply wasn't relevant enough to warrant the code complexity that would be introduced.
