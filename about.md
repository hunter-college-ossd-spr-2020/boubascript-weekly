I like solving problems (or at least attempting to). I'm a Hunter College Daedalus Scholar and Computer Science Major, and I have yet to discover a computer science subject I don't find interesting. Most of my experience is in web development, but I'm trying to *branch* out.

### More Information

I'm figuring myself out as I go. I love origami, spoken word poetry, and re-learned how to ride a bike several months ago. Also really interested in the evolution of memes as a social phenomenon.
