I like solving problems (or at least attempting to). I'm a Hunter College Daedalus Scholar and Computer Science Major, and I have yet to discover a computer science subject I *don't* find interesting. Most of my experience is in web development, but I'm trying to *branch* out.

### More Information

I've been meaning to create my own [personal blog](https://boubascript.github.io/) for a long time now, so I see this as more of a springboard for that than an assignment. Hopefully these blog posts will have all the personality I don't have in person. 

I'm figuring myself out as I go. I love bad puns, origami, and spoken word poetry, and I recently re-learned how to ride a bike several months ago. I'm also really interested in the evolution of memes as a social phenomenon.
